## Skills

### Programming!

I learned my trade at Makers Academy - see [Education](#education) for details of pragmatic and soft skills.

Using accelerate.io's tech tests to get a metric of my abilities:
- FIZZ challenge
    - [Report](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=Mears&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300)
        - Fast delivery pace. (Clock Time <= 1h 10m)
        - Great attention to detail. (Penalty <= 0m)
        - Complete test coverage. (Test Coverage = 100%)
    - [Compared to all other candidates](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=All%20candidates&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300)

### Communication skills

The ability to distil abstruse ideas into their key elements is one of my USPs.
- As a teacher, my favourite thing was managing to place the stepping stones at optimal intervals so that my students could bridge the gap between state A and state B. In that way a seemingly intractable task is reduced to a few simple steps + practice. It may be the reason my students seemed to progress faster than average.
- When I became excited by the all the parallels between concepts in linguistics and computer science, I wrote [a long-post](https://medium.com/@davidmears/programming-and-linguistics-makers-week-1-da1709051ca2) that got 46 claps on Medium.
- While at Kinder, I wrote a [blog post](https://kinder.world/blogs/company/increasing-effectiveness-with-high-quality-internal-research-19405) on their site summarizing some of the science behind, and highlighting some potential drawbacks of, their vetting framework.

### Continuous learning

I'm committed to iterative improvement through practice and study. There will never be time to learn everything, so I pride myself on knowing when to discontinue reading a book or article (diminishing returns are evil). I let the accelerating quality of my GitHub repos stand as evidence of this.

## Education

**[Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com/) Coding Bootcamp** (December 2018-March 2019)
*Taught me:*
- Essential pragmatic software skills:
    - [x] Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
    - [x] Test-Driven Development (RSpec, Jasmine)
    - [x] Model-View-Controller architecture
    - [x] Continuous Integration
    - [x] Algorithmic complexity ('Big-O' notation)
- Essential 'soft' skills:
    - [x] Healthy team dynamics: how to collaborate effectively without a project manager
    - [x] Agile and XP principles
- That I can learn very quickly when driven, and that coding projects provide that motivation

**[Royal Academy of Music](https://www.ram.ac.uk/)** (2015-17)

- MA Distinction in Clarinet Performance
- LRAM music teaching qualification

**[Cambridge University - King's College](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)** (2011-14)

- Linguistics 2.I (69%)
- [My final dissertation](https://www.academia.edu/6572064/Theoretical_accounts_of_phonetic_correlates_of_gender)

**Abingdon School** (2004-11)

- 2 A\*s (Latin, Greek) and 2 As (Music, German) at A Level
- 2 As (Maths, Physics) at AS Level

## Experience

**[Rethink Charity](https://rtcharity.org/)** (April 2019 to present)    
*Contract and voluntary work as a developer*

- I built an app for RC in a language (Python) and with frameworks (Django, unittest) not touched on by the Makers course, iterating on feedback from the client.
- After proving myself, I was invited to join the [volunteer tech team](https://github.com/orgs/rtcharity/teams/tech) working on the EA Hub website. [My PRs](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavid-mears+).

**[Kinder](https://kinder.world/)** (July-August 2018)
*Charity analysis intern*

- I applied Kinder's vetting framework on organizational competence to charities on their platform, and gave feedback to the company on their vetting framework, which showcased their self-reflective processes well enough that they decided to publish it in [blog form](https://kinder.world/blogs/company/increasing-effectiveness-with-high-quality-internal-research-19405).

**Freelance clarinettist and singer** (2015-2018)

- Outside of my two performing groups, I specialised in Creative Learning Participation: empowering people living with dementia, children with Special Educational Needs, and other groups to express themselves creatively.

**[Matrix Music School](https://www.matrixmusicschool.co.uk/)** (March 2015 to December 2018)   
*Instrumental Teacher*

- I taught children and adults to love to play the clarinet and piano.

**[Oxford School of English](https://www.oxfordschoolofenglish.com/)**  (Sep-Nov 2014, June-July 2015)

- English as a Foreign Language teaching at one of the city's most popular EFL schools.

## Hobbies and Interests

I write [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZULf__C2k8), do life-drawing, play games, and listen to podcasts on too many topics (genetics, world politics, philosophy, rationality, psychology, altruism, economics, futurism, comedy). Here are a couple of blogs: [programming](https://medium.com/@davidmears/programming-and-linguistics-makers-week-1-da1709051ca2), [fiction/eclectica](https://pelicanesis.wordpress.com/).
