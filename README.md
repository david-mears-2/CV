## Skills

### Programming

I learned my trade at Makers Academy's 16-week coding bootcamp in 2019.

- Essential pragmatic web development and software skills:
    - [x] Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
    - [x] Test-Driven Development with RSpec, Jasmine
    - [x] Model-View-Controller architecture
    - [x] Writing RESTful APIs (Rails)
    - [x] Databases: SQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL
    - [x] Continuous Integration
    - [x] Algorithmic complexity ('Big-O' notation)
    - [x] Responsive web design in React
- Essential 'soft' skills:
    - [x] How to collaborate effectively without a project manager
    - [x] Agile development and XP
    - [x] Pair-programming
    - [x] How to review code and give/receive feedback
    - [x] Creating a growth mindset through a feedback loop of achievement -> self-concept -> achievement

Using accelerate.io's tech tests to get a metric of my abilities:   
[Report](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=Mears&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300) (and [compared to all other candidates](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=All%20candidates&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300)):    
- Fast delivery pace. (Clock Time <= 1h 10m)
- Great attention to detail. (Penalty <= 0m)
- Complete test coverage. (Test Coverage = 100%)    

### Communication skills

- As a teacher, my favourite thing was managing to place the conceptual stepping stones at optimal intervals so that my students could bridge the gap between state A and state B. In that way a seemingly intractable task is reduced to a few simple steps + practice.
- In my writing, the ability to distil abstruse ideas into their key elements is one of my USPs.
    - While at Kinder, I wrote a [blog post](https://kinder.world/blogs/company/increasing-effectiveness-with-high-quality-internal-research-19405) on their site summarizing some of the science behind, and highlighting some potential drawbacks of, their vetting framework.
    - When I became excited by the all the parallels between concepts in linguistics and computer science, I wrote [a long-post](https://medium.com/@davidmears/programming-and-linguistics-makers-week-1-da1709051ca2) that got 46 claps on Medium.

### Continuous learning

I'm committed to iterative improvement through practice and study. Makers instilled in me a domain-specific growth-mindset. There will never be time to learn everything, so I pride myself on knowing when to discontinue reading a book or article (diminishing returns are evil). I let the accelerating quality of my GitHub repos stand as evidence of this.

### Collaboration

I'm at my happiest when working in a quite autonomous team to which I can meaningfully contribute, something that occurs at certain scales of musical ensembles. Makers was an excellent environment in which to hone collaborative skills such as pair-programming and healthy team dynamics, and I appreciated the constant prioritisation of process over polish. My teams worked extremely well together, holding daily standups, planning 2-day sprints, and striving for honest communication and rapid feedback. I have continued to hone my collaborative skills since then by pair-programming an [ecosystem simulator](https://github.com/ecosystem-people/ecosystem) and through my remote collaboration on the EA Hub team.

### Initiative taking

I'm practical-minded, preferring to be proactive over reactive. Here are a couple of small examples.

- During onboarding as a volunteer for SoGive, I was conscious that the founder was giving up his afternoon. I therefore asked to audio-record the process, and transcribed it into a document to be sent to new volunteers.
- At the Royal Academy of Music, there weren't many reasons, besides the bar, for players in different departments to get to know each other. That's why I founded the Book Club, which is where I met my best friends at that time.
- When I sang in Arcadian Singers, there was a dearth of music by women, even among living composers. I suggested and organised our Women Composers' Competition, which received over 30 entries.

## Experience

**[Rethink Charity](https://rtcharity.org/)** (April 2019 to present)    
*Contract and voluntary work as a developer*

- I built an app for RC in a language (Python) and with frameworks (Django, unittest) not touched on by the Makers course, iterating on feedback from the client.
- After proving myself, I was invited to join the [volunteer tech team](https://github.com/orgs/rtcharity/teams/tech) working on the EA Hub website. [My PRs](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavid-mears+).

**[Kinder](https://kinder.world/)** (July-August 2018)  
*Charity analysis intern*

- I applied Kinder's vetting framework on organizational competence to charities on their platform, and gave feedback to the company on their vetting framework, which showcased their self-reflective processes well enough that they decided to publish it in [blog form](https://kinder.world/blogs/company/increasing-effectiveness-with-high-quality-internal-research-19405).

**Freelance clarinettist and singer** (2015-2018)

- Outside of my performing groups, I specialised in Creative Learning Participation: empowering people living with dementia, children with Special Educational Needs, and other groups to express themselves creatively.

**[Matrix Music School](https://www.matrixmusicschool.co.uk/)** (March 2015 to December 2018)   
*Instrumental Teacher*

- I taught children and adults to love to play the clarinet and piano.

**[Oxford School of English](https://www.oxfordschoolofenglish.com/)**  (Sep-Nov 2014, June-July 2015)

- English as a Foreign Language teaching at one of the city's most popular EFL schools.

## Hobbies and Interests

I write [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZULf__C2k8), do life-drawing, play games, and listen to podcasts on too many topics (genetics, world politics, philosophy, rationality, psychology, altruism, economics, futurism, comedy). Here are a couple of blogs: [programming](https://medium.com/@davidmears/programming-and-linguistics-makers-week-1-da1709051ca2), [fiction/eclectica](https://pelicanesis.wordpress.com/).
