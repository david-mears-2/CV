## Skills

#### Programming

I learned my trade at Makers Academy - see [Education](#education) for details of pragmatic and soft skills.

Using accelerate.io's tech tests to get a metric of my abilities:
- FIZZ challenge
    - [Report](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=Mears&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300)
        - Fast delivery pace. (Clock Time <= 1h 10m)
        - Great attention to detail. (Penalty <= 0m)
        - Complete test coverage. (Test Coverage = 100%)
    - [Compared to all other candidates](https://report.accelerate.io/FIZ/mears0iouhka/index.html?candidate=dixe01&benchmark=All%20candidates&rangeFrom=0&rangeTo=300)

#### Communicating complex ideas through text

- I drew analogies between concepts from linguistics and computer science in [a long-post](https://medium.com/@davidmears/) that received 46 claps on Medium.
- While at Kinder, I wrote a [blog post](https://kinder.world/blogs/company/increasing-effectiveness-with-high-quality-internal-research-19405) on their site summarizing some of the science behind, and highlighting some potential drawbacks of, their vetting framework.

## Education

**[Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com/) Coding Bootcamp** (December 2018-March 2019)

Makers taught me:

    - [x] Test-Driven Development (RSpec, Jasmine)
    - [x] Model-View-Controller architecture
    - [x] Continuous Integration
    - [x] Algorithmic complexity ('Big-O' notation)
- Essential 'soft' skills:
    - [x] Healthy team dynamics: how to collaborate effectively without a project manager
    - [x] Agile and XP principles
- That I can learn very quickly when driven, and that coding projects provide that motivation

## Experience

**[Rethink Charity](https://rtcharity.org/)** (April 2019 to present)    
*Contract and voluntary work as a developer*

- I created an app for internal use by RC in a language (Python) and with frameworks (Django, unittest) not touched on by the Makers course, iterating on feedback from the client.
- After proving myself, I was invited to become part of the [volunteer tech team](https://github.com/orgs/rtcharity/teams/tech)?) working on a website for them. [My PRs](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavid-mears+)

**[Kinder](https://kinder.world/)** (July-August 2018)
*Charity analysis intern*

- I applied Kinder's vetting framework on organizational competence to charities on their platform, and gave feedback to the company on their vetting framework.

**[Freelance clarinettist and singer]** (2015-2018)

- Outside of my two performing groups, I specialised in creative learning participation: enabling people living with dementia, children with Special Educational Needs, and other groups to express themselves creatively.

**[Matrix Music School](https://www.matrixmusicschool.co.uk/)** (March 2015 to December 2018)   
*Instrumental Teacher*

- I taught children and adults to play the clarinet and piano.

**[Oxford School of English](https://www.oxfordschoolofenglish.com/)**  (Sep-Nov 2014, June-July 2015)

- Classroom teacher of English as a Foreign Language at one of the city's most popular English-language schools.

## Hobbies and Interests

I write [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZULf__C2k8), do life-drawing, play games, and listen to podcasts on eclectic topics (genetics, world politics, philosophy, rationality, psychology, altruism, economics, futurism, comedy).
